- need to think about resetting connection table
- do I want to show the hostname or ip address if the entry row is tall enough
- maybe a details page with a bugdetailspage showing the entry info
- need to handle no data better - critical
- add test for log route
- fetchFirewall isn't used!
- if no routing table entries then hide tab?
- clear pinger collection in db

Working on default routes.
Kind of done ping/fetch tests but needs historical data storing and showing in sparkline
Using comments for bridges maybe isn't the best idea - what about internet routes with client IPs?
And am I providing functionality to store static IPs and routes?
