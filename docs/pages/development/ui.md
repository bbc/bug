When developing a module GUI, here are a few guidelines:

-   Try to use existing BUG Core UI components where possible
-   All links should be underlined

## Touchscreen Use

Consider that many users will be using a touchscreen, so avoid relying on things like tooltips for vital information.
For the same reason, do not use context menus (right-click) - use a hamburger/menu icon with an <IconButton>
