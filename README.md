# BUG (Broadcast Universal Gateway)

![BUG Logo](https://github.com/bbc/bug/blob/main/src/client/public/icons/bug-logo-256x256.png?raw=true)

Control and monitor a wide range of equipment from a single web interface.

You can run BUG on a server within your network. A single web page then allows you to add panels that control equipment. Examples include, network switches, video and audio codecs, video matrixes and many more.

All the detailed information you'll need to get started is [bbc.github.io/bug](https://bbc.github.io/bug).
