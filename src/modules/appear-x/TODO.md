-   use proper api version in api calls
-   only SD/HD resolutions are currently supported
-   only integer bitrates are currently supported
-   only supports ipv4
-   is flatten/merge too slow?
-   we don't support multiple IP cards when creating outputs (yet)
-   audio add profile id is hardcoded
