- do I need to reset the connection table?
- do I want to show the hostname or ip address if the entry row is tall enough
- maybe a details page with a bugdetailspage showing the entry info
- need to handle no data better - critical
- add test for log route
- fetchFirewall isn't used!
- if no routing table entries then hide tab?
- Using comments for bridges maybe isn't the best idea - what about internet routes with client IPs?
- Am I providing functionality to store static IPs and routes?
