# Do now

- MDI icons in icon picker broken

# Do next

# Backlog

- make all user names lower-case
- sort out overlaying menu in bug api table
- move jest to vitest
- update diagrams in docs to remove watchtower
- add tests for groups
- when enabling security strategy it should warn if you're cutting off your branch
- add logs to panel dropdown in panels table
- in panel list it should show whether the module is already built
- you can crash chrome by pasting a large text in config edit code dialog
- why does the development version show module upgrades available?
- check PanelBuilding
- check PanelRowState
- need to use UTC for all panel dates
- add panel toolbar menu to logs page
- should we use process.exit() inside worker error handler
- i need a flag to prevent the module ui from loading - overlayPanel or something? When a status item is so important the panel can't run.
- error.trace isn't a thing
- check upgrade - the panel enabled should be false and it takes a long time to update
