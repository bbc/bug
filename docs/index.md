**BUG** - Broadcast User Gateway

Control and monitor a wide range of equipment from a single web interface.

# Getting Started

-   [Installation](./pages/installation.html) - Installation guide for any operating system
-   [Modules](./pages/modules.html) - A list of equipment that can be controlled and implemented fucntionality

## [Development](./pages/development.html)

We welcome development of additional modules for BUG. A module adds additional control or monitoring functionality to BUG. In principle a module normally represents control of a specific piece of hardware or a service. For example a single module exists to control Blackmagic Videohub matrices and another modules to monitor and report on a NewTek NDI discovery service.

An instance of a module is a panel. Multiple panels of the same type can co-exist in BUG. Learn more about developing your own below;
