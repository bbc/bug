- add panel status (default/success etc)
- need to think about resetting connection table
- do I want to show the hostname or ip address if the entry row is tall enough
- maybe a details page with a bugdetailspage showing the entry info
- need to handle no data better - critical
- add test for log route
- fetchFirewall isn't used!
