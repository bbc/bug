* When IP address or device is changed, we should empty the interfaces db 
* Add some sort of global state to each module - so that the panel knows whether it's connected or if there were errors?
* PROBLEM 2/4/21 GH -> NEDB doesn't allow simultanous connections. We'll have to try something else. Mongo?! :(
* remove nedb - IN PROGRESS
* need to pass panel id into mongo saves
* change database name to use panel id
