Some guidelines for the specification of hardware needed to run BUG.

# Disk Space

The BUG image itself is around 300MB. You'll need 2GB of storage space free on your hard-drive to run BUG with another 200MB for every adaitional panel you add.

# Memory

BUG itself requires 1GB of free RAM. Each container uses a maximum of 100MB of RAM, budget accordingly.

Note - If you're building a development build of BUG you'll require at least 4GB of RAM.

# CPU

## Archictecture

Currently BUG runs on x64 CPU architectures only. In future support may be extened to ARMv7 for Raspberry Pi.
