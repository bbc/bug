- add panel status (default/success etc)
- check module status (dev/beta/stable etc)

- need to think about resetting connection table
- do I want to show the hostname or ip address if the entry row is tall enough
- maybe a details page with a bugdetailspage showing the entry info
- need to handle no data better - critical
- add test for log route
- test log level for bug app
- use asyncHandler in routes
- refactor workers to improve error handling

- fetchFirewall isn't used!
