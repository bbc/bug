# Backlog

- sort out overlaying menu in bug api table
- move jest to vitest
- update diagrams in docs to remove watchtower
- add tests for groups
- when enabling security strategy it should warn if you're cutting off your branch
- add logs to panel dropdown in panels table
- in panel list it should show whether the module is already built
- why does the development version show module upgrades available?
- check PanelBuilding
- check PanelRowState
- need to use UTC for all panel dates
- add panel toolbar menu to logs page
- i need a flag to prevent the module ui from loading - overlayPanel or something? When a status item is so important the panel can't run.
- check upgrade - the panel enabled should be false and it takes a long time to update
- use logger rather than console.log
