-   add group
-   delete group
-   edit group
-   delete cue
-   add cue
-   edit cue
-   confirmation dialog for update cue - save from which playback and warn when multiple playbacks running
-   add shortcuts page with customisable buttons which can hold commands
-   add stage page with ability to flash each light
-   add shortcuts for 0%, 30%, 50%, 80%, 100% on groups rows
-   if group has word 'RGB' in it - use color dialog instead
-   name cues with dialog and fade times
-   do we need to track currently selected playback? Maybe not - would make more sense
